## Enumeration

![](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020250405173521.png)

We have a template page at port `80`.

There is an uploader that only accepts `.odt` files.

CMS is made with `umbraco`.

If we upload an `.odt` file, the file disappears in seconds. This is a phishing lab, it seems.

## Initial Access

Using this malicious ODT generator, we can craft an `.odt` with a macro to connect back on open.

Start a listener and wait.

## Privilege Escalation

Now we can put the PHP reverse shell manually in the uploads folder to pivot to the `apache` user.

Start a listener, click it, and we have a shell as `apache`.

We can impersonate, so transfer `printspoofer` and get a root shell.

## Post Exploitation
