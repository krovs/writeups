## Enumeration

The web server shows a page of medical stuff.

Let's add `apex.offsec` to `/etc/hosts`.

We have four potential users:

And a scheduler app:

We find documents in the `smb` share that can be accessed without a username or password.

With `feroxbuster`, we find a `filemanager` path, serving the same files as the `smb` share in a `documents` folder.

We can upload PHP files, but the app won't show them.

Searching with `searchsploit`:

We can search in GitHub where `sqlconf` is located, but we need to edit the script and put `Documents` in the path where the file is being copied to. This way, we can see it in the `smb` share, since here we can't see PHP files.

## Initial Access

We can access the database with the credentials and get users.
